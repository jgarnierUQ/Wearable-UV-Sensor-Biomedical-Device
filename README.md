I really loved this project! Essentially it was a wearable device that gives the user information and alerts related to their sun exposure and their unique skin type. I found it very enjoyable because I learnt about so many new concepts and technologies I hadn't been exposed to yet such as how E-Ink displays work, STM32 microcontollers, and low power modes for power saving applications. Also got to solder a 64LQFP package!!

I wrote all the firmware for interfacing to the E-Ink Display, the SD Card, and the general architecture for the main cyclic loop and where the device goes into different power saving modes. Also had my hands in some of the hardware design, with the microcontoller and SD Card. I also constructed the PCB and soldered all components by hand.
